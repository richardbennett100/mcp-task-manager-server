                    <question>Could you please specify which linter (e.g., ESLint, Prettier) and configuration preset (e.g., Standard, Airbnb, specific .eslintrc.js / .prettierrc.js) I should use?</question>
                    <answer>
                        If no explicit configuration files (like .eslintrc.js, .prettierrc.js) are found, recommend a suitable linter and configuration preset. For example, you can recommend ESLint with a standard preset like Airbnb or Standard, plus Prettier for formatting.

                    <question>Should I primarily focus on integration tests for service-level functionality, or are there specific non-data-dependent logic segments within the services you expect unit tests for?</question>
                    <answer>Write the code so that complex logic can be unit-tested separately without data context, for instance, state engine logic, lexicographical sorter, etc. I do not expect to have a lot of unit tests. Integration tests are our main tool.</answer>

                <question>The SDK doesn't export the type for the extra parameter in tool handlers, leading to the use of extra: any. Is this acceptable, or should I define a more specific local interface for the expected structure of extra?</question>
                <answer>
                    If the extra parameter and userId are no longer needed, remove them. We do not track users in this codebase.
